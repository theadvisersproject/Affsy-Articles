As you all know Apple has finally released iPhone 7 Red so midway through the life cycle of iPhone 7 we get this brand new color. We've seen this color before ipods and accessories but finally we get it now on iPhone.

Very similar to jet black this is only available in the two larger capacities of <em>128 and 256 GB</em>  so it means you do have to pay a bit more to get this phone because you can't get the 32 GB model.

And of course let's have a look on unboxing.
<h3>Unboxing iPhone 7 Red</h3>

It's so easy just remove the tape and get rid of plastic and yeah. So on lifting up the cover you actually don't see the phone but the paperwork so paperwork in the case has tweak for this specific model that's because this is a model red.

The reason is some of the money from this product goes to a cause and you can find out more by going to the link <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/special-edition-iphone-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
<h3>iPhone 7 Red Review</h3>

After unboxing the phone actually looks like a silver phone because the front is white and a silver touch ID ring but as soon as you flip it over you get this very stunning vibrant red color, so the more light you have on this the more it glows.

This phone is really stunning in person, so on peeling off all the plastic to reveal the final finish it is the matte finish very similar to the other iphones that anodized aluminum finish this is not like the jet black glossy finish. So it should be pretty durable.

The other thing you might notice right away is that the inset apple logo is silver instead of a matching color or matching tone as we see with the touch ID button. But unlike the other iphones with a white bezel and camera lines are matching to the color of the chassis.
<h4>Accessories</h4>
So setting that aside let's take a quick look on accessories which are all familiar, we get a 5 watt power adapter along with a set of ear pods and lastly very compactly we have is the lightning cable for charging the phone.
<h4>Software and features</h4>
In terms of software and features there really is no difference between this and other iphone 7s so if you want to see more information about iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus i'll make another post for this.

<em>Terms of this color its impressive</em>. Now this is an anodized aluminum finish so that texture sort of reflects the color bit differently depending on the angle or source of the light provided. So in depth if you have more light on it, it'll look more better.

<em>So yeah, if you're looking for a better color and great finish phone while donating a part of it to a cause, it really worth it.</em>
