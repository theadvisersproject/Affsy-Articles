Basics of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in WordPress
Let‚Äôs take a look to first thing, that is, what is SEO?
SEO
As you may know by looking at the title of this post, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Which is a process of optimizing your website or content in order to rank higher in search engines. In this blog, When I say search engine, I mostly refer to Google search engine because it is on the top.
Now, let‚Äôs have a look to how and why would you write content which is highly search engine optimized.
How to write quality content?
To write a quality content on your blog or website, you must have to focus on one keyword. Basically a focus keyword is a word on which the whole posts revolves around. For example, I have written a blog post on puppies so I have to include the word puppies almost 3 times with understandable meanings to make the content revolve around that keyword.

Another important factor in writing quality content is active voice. Make sure to not to write anything in a passive voice because avoiding passive voice is great if you want to write an article which is nice and easy to read. Texts using passive voice are hard to read as well as are bad for in terms of search engine optimization.

One more thing plays an important role in your article, that is, make sure no paragraph is too long. Write short paragraphs.

No subheadings in your content should exceed more than 300 words. If you have a large content revolving around the same topic, try to make it short. And if not short, put types of subheadings correctly defining content below it in one or more than one word.

Here it is all about how to write a quality content and why should you write it, now let‚Äôs have a look to some other major ranking factors.

Focus Keyword
As I state earlier, focus keyword is a word on which your content is based. This is the most important part of any content and is understandable to both the human readers and search engine robots.

For example, if you type any keyword on search engine, let‚Äôs say, ‚Äúhow do I optimize my images‚Äù basically, what you‚Äôre typing is not a question, but a set of keywords such as ‚Äúhow‚Äù, ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù, ‚Äúimages‚Äù.

Google will look to your keywords and present you a content which is using the keywords you‚Äôve asked it for.

Let‚Äôs say, I search in Google for a ‚Äúbed sheet‚Äù well what happen? Google will present me the list of stores or places like Amazon selling bed sheets.

I hope now you understand why focus keyword is important, next move to other major factor.

Meta Description
You may have heard of providing descriptions to what we sell in order to make our customers recognize what we actually are selling.

Similarly, meta description defines to the readers and search engine that what kind of content your article is having.

Basically, I suggest to use a meta description of around 100 characters which is going to be enough to let humans understand what you‚Äôve actually written about in your post.

Optimized Images
As you all know, only the content without images doesn‚Äôt appear pretty good. So you should add some high quality images.. but wait! High quality images will be of higher sizes which is slow to load and makes your webpage slower.

What should you do now?

Well, we have a solution !

Permalinks
Make sure your links should not contain any underscore or anything which is hard to remember. Separate the words in your link using dashes (-) and make sure the link are easy to remember for humans as well as for search engines.

Complex permalinks are huge disadvantage for SEO ranking.

Your post title
While making a post, you‚Äôre making it for both the search engines and humans so make sure to put your focus keyword in your title and try to make it kind of descriptive.

Just a simple suggestion, Make a title which has at least 65 characters including the focus keyword.

Important tools that you can use to write better SEO optimized content
If you look on the Internet, there are various tools available that can help you write SEO optimized content easily. But make sure to write the content on your own, do ever not copy someone‚Äôs else content.

If you‚Äôre using wordpress to write your articles, there are few plugins that you can use that can help you write better.
