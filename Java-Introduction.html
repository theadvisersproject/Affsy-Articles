<h3>Java Development Process</h3>
The basic development process of any program in this language includes the following stages:

After trying out and fixing any existing insects, you may be prepared to distribute your application to endusers.

Usually, most programs are allotted the use of a java archive document, which has the .Jar extension.
<h3>Java Development Kit</h3>
You can run, save and share your Java codes on many online compilers such as:
<blockquote><a href="https://www.codechef.com/ide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeChef Compiler</a>

<a href="http://www.browxy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browxy Compiler</a>

<h3>JDK &amp; PATH</h3>
<strong>Step 1.</strong> On windows, the JDK will install by default in the directory "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_xx" with the latest upgrade number indicated by xx.
<ul>
 	<li>JRE defaults to "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_xx".</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 2.</strong> Open the JDK folder, open the bin folder, and copy the path, which you will need to use in the next step.

<strong>Three.</strong> For the JDK to work, you need to add its parth to the PATH environment variable.

<strong>Step 7.</strong> You should just see "New Variable User" window while adding the PATH.

<strong>Step 8.</strong> After adding, save changes.

<strong>Final Step.</strong> To Verify that JDK is properly install, open the command prompt, type in javac, and press enter. If the JDK has been successfully install, you will see some lines of text inside the command prompt.
<blockquote>And you're ready to move forward !</blockquote>
