In this article I'll tell you about  top 3 must have iphone applications. The applications are categorized for photography, email client management and a cool replacement of default dull music app.
<h2>So which are the Top 3 iPhone applications?</h2>
As we all know iPhones are really great phones and the usability gets even better. Thanks to app store with voice of over 2 million apps but some of those apps are good and some are badass.

These iphone applications are badass and you can download them for FREE (except one on 'em) ! So let's start our list.
<h3>MuseCam, iphone applications made for photographers !</h3>
Better than the most applications available in apple app store for photography through the phone. The camera captures vivid and good photos but with a little bit of editing they end up looking even better.

Well thankfully there is a really great app for doing that and is called MuseCam<em>. </em>

This app is an extremely powerful but surprisingly easy to use photo editor for the iphone.

It has a lot of features including the basic ones like exposure, contrast, highlights and shadow, along with some advanced ones like RGB curves color by color adjustments for hue saturation, luminance and much more !

The application will definitely improve the quality of your photos and it is a must have for anyone who edits photos on the go.

Spark is not as good as Newton (The $50 application) neither this app has color coded inbox. But this app is pretty great app nonetheless its fast and it automatically categorize your email and let you quickly make a way to inbox.

The app offers features such as snoozing emails, swipe your email right to mark it read and left to either pin or delete.

<em>You can even change the default swiping features if you don't like them and can set them which are appropriate to you.</em>

All in All the app is a great client for emails for iPhone and I definitely recommend Spark to manage your emails on a peak.

<h3>Cesium, A music application that people love ♥</h3>
iPhone is disliked by a lot of people because it tries to do a lot of things all at once and it usually fails miserably. If you are one of the people that<em> simply don't want to use the default music app</em>, you should definitely checkout cesium.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1342 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/screen696x696-1.jpeg" alt="Cesium - must have iphone application" width="392" height="696" />

Cesium is an amazing alternative application for playing music. It automatically hooks into your music library and shows all of your songs in a simple yet appealing interface.

Songs that are added to your iCloud music library are available to be download. If however you only want to see your local music, you can simply turn off show iCloud items in the app settings.

It also has some very nice swipe gestures that you find extremely useful. The settings for the app has a lot of customization options that you can play along.

<em>To download cesium you've a pay a little fees that is required on it but trust me, it'll worth it.</em>
