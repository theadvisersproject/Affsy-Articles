Since we've been getting pretty good response on the last article on <a href="http://www.affsy.ooo/top-3-iphone-applications/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 3 iPhone Applications that You Must have</a>. Writing about Rayman Adventures for iPhone gamers, I considered as a fair bet.

Due to lack of time to write I'm going to make separate posts for each game for you guys to enjoy every post completely.
<h2>RayMan Adventures</h2>
So first of all if you're a adventure gaming fan <em>RAYMAN ADVENTURES IS JUST FOR YOU !</em>

And the most awesome thing that I loved about RayMan Adventures is that it is available for <em>free</em> in apple store and android play store <em>(lol).</em>

First of all the graphics are amazing, it's in the same style as the last few rayman games and personally I really loved that. The second rayman trademark that you have in this game is free adorable little creatures, usually they are just collectible but in this game they are your companions.

You can choose to take them with you on your adventure and they give you certain bonus.

The red one you can see here is acts as a shield and can give you bonus that you can hit one time before being dying.

The green ones can help you find treasure, the blue ones helps you suck up the lumps and there's probably many more that I haven't discovered yet.

At the end of every level you see your results and if you are fast enough to collect some extra points and kill lot of bad guys, you get more rewards and those rewards are also the currency in game.

Of course, you can use real money to buy the currency but so far I haven't had to use the real money to get further in game.

And the most important part of the game is of course the Gameplay. The fact that every level gives a different type of challenge that really keeps the game refreshing. It's not just the same every new level but it keeps switching.

Also, it has variety of mini-games that you can play but honestly I don't like them much because I suck at probably all of them.
