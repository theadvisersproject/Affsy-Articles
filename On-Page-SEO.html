<h1>What is On-Page SEO ?</h1>
On-Page SEO refers to the techniques that you use within your pages in website to get Google interested in your site.

<em>The other definition of On-Page SEO explained by the search engine optimization giant <a title="" href="https://moz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moz</a> is:</em>
<blockquote><b>On-page SEO</b> is the practice of optimizing individual web <b>pages</b> in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. <b>On-page</b> refers to both the content and HTML source code of a <b>page </b>that can be optimized, as opposed to off-<b>page SEO </b>which refers to links and other external signals.</blockquote>
Well regardless of changes that have happened in past Google algorithms, it is still possible to differentiate our SEO into largely on-page and<a href="http://www.affsy.ooo/off-page-seo-helps-good-sales-high-rankings/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> off-page seo</a>.

I hope you've already gone through <a href="http://www.affsy.ooo/modern-search-engine-optimization/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Search Engine Optimization Techniques</a>. For basic understanding of aspects that are helpful to rank your web page.

This begins with content - as I've discussed in my earlier posts, this is really important.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1471 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/315deua.png" alt="paragraph seperator" width="590" height="60" />
<h2>How to Make Good Content</h2>
One of the things that you need is to do a perfect keyword research and will your content with those keywords.

The most important thing that you have to keep in mind is that you need to repeat keywords in your content a few times to ensure that you create that association.

But, at the same time, you also need to make sure that you're not over doing it and thereby appear to be spamming (or stuffing of keywords).

As I mentioned in my last post, you should have a keyword density for on-site content at max. 2 percent. That means <strong>you can use your keyword once every 100-200 words.</strong>

Another important aspect you have to take care of is that the user <em>always</em> comes first.

So, if you can fit the keyword naturally in your article, which means the keyword should appear in a manner that it is not stuffed and coming up in articles a lot of times.

Well, here we have a solution, <strong>if you can't fit your keyword naturally, don't worry ! Just forget it and use it in your image alt-attributes etc.</strong>
<h3>Length of Your Posts</h3>
Second, the length of your posts is also an important consideration. Back in the days of spammy-SEO, almost all posts were 500 words long. Today, <em>you'll have the most success writing posts that are longer and more in-depth</em>.

(like this one :p )

Simply imagine that your reader is going to sit down with a cup of tea and really dive deep into the subject - that's the kind of experience that you should be delivering !

<img class="size-full wp-image-1475 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/measurement-millimeter-centimeter-meter-162500.jpeg" alt="length measurment" width="940" height="627" />

This has another advantage because it means you can repeat your keyword a lot more times. For example,<em> if you use your keyword 100 times and your content is 5000 words long, this fulfills the recommended structure of stuffing just 2% keywords.</em>

But again, remember that you server your visitors first and foremost. These are the people that you want to impress and that means you should not worry about too much length to make it clear and understandable.

And, lastly, try to vary the lengths of your posts a little. This again looks more natural and suggests to Google that you're not following a 'formula' of any kind to rank your site!

<img class="size-full wp-image-1471 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/315deua.png" alt="paragraph seperator" width="590" height="60" />
<h2>The Conversational Google</h2>
To get Google love your content you sometimes have to use a term called "LSI" or "Latent Semantic Indexing" which means now Google understands the actual meaning instead of just looking for similar keywords.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1476 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-57825.jpeg" alt="conversation" width="940" height="627" />

The way it do that is by looking at synonyms and related terms to your keyword. In short, <strong>don't just use the exact keyword but be sure to use lots of relevant and related words.</strong>

This is important because it prevents mismatch between searches. If someone search for a word, for example, 'duck', how does Google know whether they mean the animal or the movement? Simple: By looking for related terms like "duckling" and "feather" or perhaps "dodge" and "dive".

At the same time, the use of synonyms and related words again show Google that there is lots of content revolving around the same topic - It's not just a case of having mentioned the search term a few times in an otherwise irrelevant piece of writing.

So if you're writing about positive sayings, then you need to make sure to including lots of related words like,
<blockquote>affective quotes

inspirational thoughts</blockquote>
Doing this will confirm the subject matter of your site and will look a lot more natural and useful than if you just use a keyword.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1471 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/315deua.png" alt="paragraph seperator" width="590" height="60" />
<h2>Schemas and Structured Data</h2>
You may have heard of rich snippets. Using 'structured data' you can highlight to Google certain key elements of your content, like, recipes, dates, company names, author names, and so on.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1474 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-52558.jpeg" alt="structure" width="940" height="627" />

This helps Google show some of the information in the <em>SERPs (Search Engine Page Results)</em> and thereby attracts more visitors to your site. There are plugins in Wordpress that will let you do this easily, or you can do it through <strong>meta tags</strong>.

Either way, you'll use this to do things like highlighting the ingredients in a recipe, or the show times of play, or the score in a review.

This is important because it lets Google understand your content even better than it is already able to. <em>Google is no longer just a search engine but rather an AI</em> - this is the direction that Google is heading in and being able to understand and utilize this might just be the key to SEO success in future.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1471 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/315deua.png" alt="paragraph seperator" width="590" height="60" />
<h2>Design and Layout, An Important aspect of On-Page SEO</h2>
The next most important component of on-page seo is site design itself. Using breadcrumbs for instance can help a lot, as can using alt-attributes for your images so that Google knows what they are of.

More important is the actual function of your website: does the page load quickly? Is it mobile friendly? Mobile friendliness in particular is something you can not ignore in 2017 and beyond. Because almost 80% visitors your site are through mobile phones.
<blockquote>You can analyze your website's mobile friendliness and aspects to make it faster through either <a href="https://gtmetrix.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTmetrix.com</a>.

Or you can use <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights">Google's page speed checker tool</a>.</blockquote>
The most important thing is to avoid using too many plugins on your website, because it slows the website down. Again, if your website looks good and have good speed than this helps people on your site longer because it will be enjoyable for them to be there.

Read one of my article on f<a href="http://www.affsy.ooo/modern-search-engine-optimization/amp/">actors affecting Google page rankings of your website</a>. You'll find out why website speed is necessary. <em>In short, It'll drop down your bounce rate which is good for your website's ranking. </em>
<h3>Psychology behind colors</h3>
Do you know that using light colors, like light blues, can actually help to keep people on the page longer by making them feel more relaxed? Consider this when picking your theme.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1473 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-194098.jpeg" alt="psychology behind colors" width="940" height="625" />

Likewise, choose a theme that will adapt to the size of the display viewing it and make sure that you take advantage of things like caching to keep your site happy. Themes that do this are called <strong>responsive</strong>, in that they response to the shape and size of the display they're being viewed on.

This works by removing certain elements, by rearranging menus etc. and by shrinking images.
<h3>Mobile Friendliness Defines Good On-Page SEO</h3>
Note that, mobile friendliness also means things like having large buttons (which are easier to click with a finger rather than a mouse) and also avoiding 'mouse-over' drop-down menus that again can't be operated on a mobile without a mouse.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1470 aligncenter" src="http://www.affsy.ooo/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-63572.jpeg" alt="mobile friendliness " width="940" height="625" />

The best way to ensure that your website is responsive, that it looks the part and that it will encourage the maximum engagement, just through your on-page seo, is to use WordPress. WordPress is a CMS (Content Management System) that makes it incredibly easy to build a responsive website and then add a custom theme that you have downloaded (free or paid) or made yourself.

Seeing as WordPress is free, you're really just making life harder for yourself by using anything other than it to build your website.
