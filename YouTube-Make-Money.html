Howdy buddies! It’s Shivam Tiwari back here and today I am going to show you..

How to make money by uploading your videos on YouTube.
First let’s start with creating your channel on YouTube, so, Go on the website or click here to redirect to the site. After which click on login if you already have an account on gmail and if you don’t, no problem ! Click on register and make an account.

Now, you’re ready to get jump into learning how to make big bucks using just a single website !

All right great so far. Let’s start.

How will you earn?
To understand how will you earn completely, you need to understand how your video ranks on tube and what factors does it include.

It’s great that you are with me so far. Now, most of you will ask, how will the website pay you or how will you make bucks on it? Right?

So let’s begin with first step. When you upload a video on youtube you put some tags with it. As you can see a few tags added by me on this post down below in the bottom before comment section.

The tags on your video will work the same. It’ll identify what kind of video you have uploaded. For example, If I upload a video or rabbits eating the grass, I would use tags such as “rabbits, eating grass, love rabbits” and so forth. 

Basically what happens is when someone search for a tag on tube search, the algorithms of tube with look on the whole site for the same tags and present the videos in front you, for what you made a search.

I will discuss about how to know which tags can rank your videos in what time in my next article.

And when someone clicks on your video that comes up for the search that he made ! Guess what happens ! You earn ! Yeah! Also, not just you earn but your video gets eyes of tube’s algorithms and it’ll rank it even higher or sometimes will show in Google search results itself.

Also, it is important that you should monetize your videos in order to earn. Well, let’s discuss what monetization is.

Monetization:
Well monetization is a process in tube which puts ads to your videos and when user watches the full length ad or clicks on it, you get paid.

I will post more about how to manage monetization on your videos and how to enable monetization in further sessions of my articles. So stay tuned.

Now, I suppose you know how does you earn on tube. Well, this basic knowledge is enough to take you there when you make several bucks on tube itself.

Well, let’s move to other section that is the term represented by being lazy.

Being lazy:
Well, everyone on youtube doesn’t really make their own videos and inside being lazy i’ll define you how can you too be a lazy and earn !

If you’re lazy to make your own videos on tube you can upload other people’s videos !

Let me show you how this works !

First, search for any term you like. For example, I’ll search for rabbits. And I get my results on the screen ! Videos related to rabbits ! Yeah, that’s what I wanted.

Now, here the game begins. Click on the filter option right above the search results as shown in the image below, and select Creative Commons . 

how to find option of creative commons
The image above shows you where the option for creative commons exists.

Now when you select creative commons, you have completed your first step to be a lazy tube’s money maker!

What is Creative Commons and How does it makes you a lazy?
Well, Creative Commons is an option given inside tube which will put on videos related to your search that you can re-upload by just simply downloading it and uploading back from your own channel.

You can even monetize them to make your earnings. That is what a “being lazy” concept is. If you have any questions regarding this, please comment down below and I’ll get back to you ASAP.
