On Wednesday 19 April 2017 at the Beijing University of Technology Gymnasium Xiaomi MI 6 is officially launched. The expected price of this new smartphone is going to be around 23,499 indian rupees and around $363 USD.

Let's talk about in detail that why everyone is waiting for this phone !
<h1>Xiaomi MI 6 - Why to Buy?</h1>
Well, I'm not an easy customer to please so when I say I like a phone, it needs to be special. And thankfully the Xiaomi Mi 6 is one.

The speciality starts from the looks of the smart phone, the phone looks very tempting but you need to understand that Xiaomi is known as the <em>Apple of china </em>and for that reason there would be enough similarities that you may find between the Mi Phone and the iPhone.

The two major changes that have happened in Xiaomi Mi 6 are first, the phone is curved from all angles, not just from left and right even from top and bottom.

Which makes it look good and also makes it feel very good in the palm. The second thing is, there is a stainless steel frame that took 12 days to manufacture :O All I hope is that Mi 6 is more durable than the Mi 5.

Also, the fingerprint scanner is now beneath the display which is something very commandable because even Samsung wasn't even able to do this with the Samsung Galaxy S8.

Next, What I like about it is that the phone is available in three colors <em>black, white &amp; blue </em>.  And i'm going to buy the blue one.

Unlike an iPhone however this phone is not waterproof instead it's splash proof :| One more thing that I like about this phone unlike an iphone is that the <strong>Camera!</strong>
<h2>Camera of The Latest Xiaomi MI 6</h2>
The phone comes with dual camera at the back and if you haven't guessed it already the second shooter is a telephoto lens which just like an iPhone helps you zoom twice upto the distant object.

And if that's not enough similarity for you, The phone also has a portrait mode for depth of field and even the megapixel down to the same as iPhone which is <em>Dual 12 MP Primary Camera.</em>

However you do get goodies like <em>4k video recording and 4 axis gyroscope</em> <em>and the</em> <em>front camera who has now been improved which now stands at 8 MegaPixles.</em>
<h2>Processor, Memory and Version of Android</h2>
The phone is has a Snapdragon 835 processor which is both blazing fast and power efficient and it also powers devices like Samsung Galaxy S8 but on Xiaomi you get 2 GB more of RAM.

Totally, you get a 6 GB of RAM on the new Xiaomi MI 6 which may be a need because MIUI is bit heavy comparing to stock android but it comes with Android Nougat, right out of the box.
<h2>Battery &amp; HeadPhone Jack</h2>
Now one more thing in compare to the iPhone that is, <em>Mi 6 does not have a headphone jack</em>. <strong>But remember I already mentioned in the starting that it's a phone i'm gonna buy?</strong> Well here's why.

This phone checks two boxes that not a lot of new and upcoming smartphones do. This phone has got a compact 5.15 inch screen.

Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with a huge 3350 mAh of battery that makes the phone last throughout the working hours of the day. In fact, here's an official comparison from Xiaomi tweeted on 19 April.

<h2>Model Variants and UnOfficial Price Range</h2>
So having said all that its not the time for me to give you my opinion on the Xiaomi Mi 6's success specification sheet. To be honest the only thing that goes against it is the fact that the inspiration really comes from Apple iPhone.

But that's not a bad thing in my opinion because you can get almost all those features of iPhone 7 on the fraction of its price inside Mi 6 .

And for those people like me who prefer compact phones, this phone is something fit for our preference. Having said all that, the phone is available in multiple variants i.e.,
<blockquote>64 GB storage and  6 GB RAM for 23,500 INR

128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM for 27,000 INR

Ceramic Edition for 28,000 INR</blockquote>
