Google has recently introduced its another smart project "Google Gnome" which works with Netflix (only if you have a premium streaming membership).

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', Arial, 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff;">GNOME was originally an acronym for </span><i style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', Arial, 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; background: none #ffffff; color: #222222;">GNU Network Object Model Environment</i><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, 'Nimbus Sans L', Arial, 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff;"> but the acronym was dropped because it no longer reflected the vision of the GNOME project.</span>
Anyway, from my views it worth a review, so let's get started.

:)
<h2>Google Gnome - Outdoor and Indoor</h2>
Google Gnome outdoor is a kind of AI - more advanced than SiRi I guess. You can assign it tasks such as turning on grass cutter on your command.

Or you can ask it about the weather today ! Or you can ask random questions such as " 'Nome, Can I eat a lemon tree leaf ?" Just anything ! You can do with ultra smart Gnome.

And the funniest part I loved about this product is that it is a nerd ! Yep ! Try asking him a simple thing, "Should I compose my wrapper of McDonalds ? " And it'll tell you all the scientific definitions including "we all are composable and if we compose it turns into an organic matter..." I am not going that deep though..

Anyway, The smart yard is here !

The Gnome indoor will be happily turn on your fan, air conditioner, or can play in-door music for you. And if you wanna watch some of your favorite TV shows, why not just ask it <em>Gnome, tune up the show "Friends" </em>and tada !

Have your smart indoor and outdoor with Google Gnome.
