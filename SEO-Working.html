Have you ever wondered how does SEO work? Which is one of the best way to rank your website in search engine results..

The goal of this article is to give you a basic overview of how does SEO work so you can better understand what SEO is all. So let's get started.
<h1>How does SEO work these days according with search engines</h1>
So as of today there is over 130 million registered websites out there on the Internet to sort though all of us rely on search engines to find what we want, and these search engines have so good that over ninety percent of people using the Internet rely on them to find things.

There's a lot of good search engines out there but about eighty three percent of people worldwide use Google, so that's what we will use in this article.

Just keep in mind that the concepts that I am going to discuss in this article will apply on other search engines too.

When you search something with Google you get back a results page and there's lots of stuff on them. A small text on left upper corner (marked in blue) of the search results shows you how many web sites Google found that are probably relevant to what you're looking for.

Here, companies can pay Google to place ads for when people search for a specific thing(marked in red). But the actual search results (marked in green) is the section most people care about.

The list in green is just a list of websites that contain the relevant content or similar content that you're looking for. Notice, this is just the first results page, Gooooogle have even more pages !

<h2>People's behavior to search engine results</h2>
Now, here's the important part that most people just don't know, over 94% of people that use Google only clicks on results of this first page and if they don't find what they're looking for they subsequently don't bother clicking on more results instead they typically prefer to adjust their search terms and start from scratch.

And for those people who do click on first page most only sometimes click on what referred to as the <em><strong>golden triangle</strong> or top 3 results on the first page</em>.

This is why, optimizing your websites for search engine or doing SEO is really necessary, if people search for something and they see it in your website, they click on your pages and visit your website to find the content they need.

And these aren't just any visitors, these are people that are looking for exactly what you offer so of anyone they're most likely to convert into customers of yours. But if your website is not showing in top three results or so or if it is not showing on the first page, it's almost like your website doesn't exists.

<h2>Regarding our example</h2>
So in our example we've searched for "small business marketing" and we get about 740 million results. It is not even a small number.

Have you ever wondered why some websites show up on the first page and others get stuck on way down the bottom of pile?

Well a site position in search results is determined by what's referred to as page rank. Every website has a ranking for particular search terms or keywords.

In the beginning the first search engines worked by tracking all the words on pages, so if you search for small business marketing, you'd get back a list of websites containing those three keywords and the websites that had those words most often were ranked higher and they showed up towards the top live result pages.

So if you know about the past of SEO you can compare how different it is now after the arrival of new algorithms of search in Google search engine.

<h2>What Search Engines do now to rank your website? And how does SEO work?</h2>
Search engines still look at your website for keywords but they then rank your site's relevance on the number of quality backlinks to it from other websites, so think of it like this..

<em>Keywords let's Google see your site and know what's its about. Backlinks determine how much Google trusts your site to be relevant. So keyword is important because they tell Google that you're out there but backlinks move your website up the stack. </em>

That's why the search results you see are called organic or natural results. They're constantly changing based on what people actually do out there on web.

Unsuprisingly, as there are two aspects to how search engines find and rank pages there are two corresponding components to SEO.
<h3>One. On-Site Component</h3>
This is where you ensure your site is full of keywords that are relevant to what your site's about.

So for example, if you have a small business marketing website you want to make sure relevant keywords are on your site like, "business", "marketing", etc. things like that.

<h3> Two. Off-Site Component</h3>
This is where you work to create backlinks to your website that originate from other sources.

Links to your site can create using articles, social media, blog posts, discussion boards and so on.

<em>But keep this in mind that most influential or legitimate the website is that links back to you, the more effect that backlink from that website is going to have on your search rankings.</em>

So that's it. Now you exactly know how much SEO is important and how does SEO work.

As everyone relies on search engines to find what they looking for, SEO is the most effective way to increase traffic to your site. Good SEO takes time so the sooner you start the soon you move up the results ladder.
